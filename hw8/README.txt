HW8
C++
Due: March 5, 2015

Drivers are created and serve as the solutions for homework all homework
assignments with the exception of HW 8.2, which has a driver, but which
has its solution largely implemented in the LockFreeStack.h file. 

Please use make to compile.

HW8-4.cpp is simply a comment. I was thinking of typing up some code,
but then thought that maybe that was overkill. I also had work for other
classes that needed to be done. Even so, I am fairly confident that that
is the problem we were supposed to look for.

Thank you!
