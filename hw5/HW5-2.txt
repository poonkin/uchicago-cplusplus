Homework 5 Problem 2
Time Results

All times were comparable, but after a few tests,
it seems that specialization runs the best on average.
Even so, the times for overloading and specialization 
were remarkably close, and while specialization
had the best average time, I did notice one 
particular instance that had a time of as 
slow as 20 seconds! While it may just have been OS 
noise or some other unrelated factor, it was a bit odd.

The better timing is probably due to the compile-time nature of
working with templates. It reveals the overall power of
templates and generic programming, not only for its
flexibility and expressiveness but also for its performance
power.

Please see the header files for PSMatrix and OverloadMatrix for the relevant code.
