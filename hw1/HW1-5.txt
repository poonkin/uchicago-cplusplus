Why is C++ called C++ and not ++C?

As the professor mentioned, there is no correct answer to this question.

Below are my ideas, which are largely informed by my knowledge of the
most common usage of the operator.

The prefix operator changes something before it is used, completely
voiding the previous state of the variable before it can be saved
or assigned or even have influence over anything else in the program.
In one line, with just one discrete step of the program, the old state
is lost forever. If I were to take C and prefix increment the language, it would be one part disrespectful and one part damning. It would be an overwhelming declaration of the language's uselessness and replacement by the new C with Classes. I don't think Stroustrup intended to replace C. I think he intended to keep the original C (to return it after the increment operation) as it still had its place, but ultimately to modernize its core features into a more general-purpose language. In this way, the uses of C could be retained, even if they were increasingly replaced by the features of C++.

It could also be a way of saying that the language is not yet complete.
Again, less finality; C could still be assigned or used or whatever.

It could also just sound better. Marketing is pretty important, after all!
