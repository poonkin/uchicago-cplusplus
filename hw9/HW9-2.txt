The signature should use a unique_ptr or some kind of smart pointer:

void f2(unique_ptr<A>);

A thread could release a smart pointer back to a caller that has already
run out of scope when threading is used. This would have the effect of 
a memory leak. It can also happen when release is called after an object
is allocated to a unique pointer from within the same function. There is
no caller.
