To int const, or to const int, that is the question?

I think "const int" is the better choice. It more directly correlates with
its meaning in pointer form. When I write "const Type var," I want the Type
to be immutable; I'm not even considering the memory address, as it is
static. If I were to change this to a pointer, i.e. const * Type, or
even with one line instantiating with const * Type var = new Type, I would expect
it to have the same behavior as when written in the static form. In C++,
however, const * Type is a pointer to constant data, while Type * const
is a constant pointer, i.e. it cannot change its memory address, but the
data can change. By writing Type const, I could be setting myself up
for future confusion. Better to leave that ordering reserved for when
it is used with pointers (Type * const) so that there is less possibility
of confusion.
