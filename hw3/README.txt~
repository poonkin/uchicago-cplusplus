Readme for HW 3

HW 3.1

The program utilizes two classes. One initializes the ios while constructing and also adds a little comma
between Hello and World while destructing. This class is called ForceInit. The other class, Hello_World, 
first creates a static ForceInit and then prints Hello while constructing. It prints World while destructing.
From the comments in the program:

The sequence of events:
 * First, a Hello_World is declared and its constructor called. Its constructor instantiates
 * ForceInit, and then prints "Hello" JUST AFTER ForceInit's constructor inits cout. In stack
 * fashion, the ForceInit destructor is called first as the program exits, which prints ", ".
 * Finally, the Hello_World destructor is called, which prints "world!" and endl. The end.
 
HW 3.2

Fairly straight forward. The example code from HW 3.2 was used pretty much verbatim 
in main (with one slight modification, as ostream_iteratorrequired cout and the string, 
not just the ", " string). I assumed that using this code was desired, and that we were simply
supposed to write the Nth_Power class. Writing the functor was fairly straight forward.
This implementation accepts and returns an int. If a vector of doubles is transformed, they will
lose precision. This was intended; the example code uses a vector of ints, so this functionality
was assumed to be desired.
